# Avax Advanced - Module-1 (Defi Empire, A Simple DeFI Kingdom Clone)
This solidity contract simply replicates the Defi Empire game functionalities

## Description

An in-depth paragraph about your project and overview of use.

## Getting Started
### Executing program
To run this program, you can use Remix, an online Solidity IDE. To get started, go to the Remix website at https://remix.ethereum.org/.

Once you are on the Remix website, create a new file by clicking on the "+" icon in the left-hand sidebar. Save the file with a .sol extension (e.g., erc20.sol). Copy and paste the following code into the file:

pragma solidity ^0.8.17;

contract ERC20 {
    uint public totalSupply;
    mapping(address => uint) public balanceOf;
    mapping(address => mapping(address => uint)) public allowance;
    string public name = "Solidity by Example";
    string public symbol = "SOLBYEX";
    uint8 public decimals = 18;

	event Transfer(address indexed from, address indexed to, uint value);
    event Approval(address indexed owner, address indexed spender, uint value);

    function transfer(address recipient, uint amount) external returns (bool) {
        balanceOf[msg.sender] -= amount;
        balanceOf[recipient] += amount;
        emit Transfer(msg.sender, recipient, amount);
        return true;
    }

    function approve(address spender, uint amount) external returns (bool) {
        allowance[msg.sender][spender] = amount;
        emit Approval(msg.sender, spender, amount);
        return true;
    }

    function transferFrom(
        address sender,
        address recipient,
        uint amount
    ) external returns (bool) {
        allowance[sender][msg.sender] -= amount;
        balanceOf[sender] -= amount;
        balanceOf[recipient] += amount;
        emit Transfer(sender, recipient, amount);
        return true;
    }

    function mint(uint amount) external {
        balanceOf[msg.sender] += amount;
        totalSupply += amount;
        emit Transfer(address(0), msg.sender, amount);
    }

    function burn(uint amount) external {
        balanceOf[msg.sender] -= amount;
        totalSupply -= amount;
        emit Transfer(msg.sender, address(0), amount);
    }
}
```
To compile the code, click on the "Solidity Compiler" tab in the left-hand sidebar. Make sure the "Compiler" option is set to "0.8.4" (or another compatible version), and then click on the "Compile erc20.sol" button.

Once the code is compiled, you can deploy the contract by clicking on the "Deploy & Run Transactions" tab in the left-hand sidebar. Select the "erc20" contract from the dropdown menu, and then click on the "Deploy" button.

Now you can test various functions of the code.
